<INSTALLATION:> <h3 id="C3">Chapter 3</h3>
I first created a Repositorygit in GitHub.
I creatively named my Repository Horiseon_Optimization_Into_The_Future.
I did not create a README.md.
I then cloned the Repository onto my computer by going into the gitbash.
I imput git clone Horiseon_Optimization_Into_The_Future
I then went to the source code and copied the source code to the repository.
git status
git add .
This got me the source code and the repository on my computer.
I edited the code to make it more concise and organized.
Added Screenshots to the repository
See notes in index.html for further notes on changes to actual html code.
Checked the Style.css sheet for errors and renamed some ids and classes.
